\textbf{Exercise 1.1.1}:
Given functions $\sigma: A \rightarrow B$ and $\tau: B \rightarrow C$,
prove that if $\tau \circ \sigma$ is injective, then so is $\sigma$.

\begin{proof}
Let's setup a proof by contradiction, assume $\sigma$ is not injective, then by
definition there exists two distinct values $a_1$, $a_2$ $\in A$ such that 
$\sigma(a_1) = \sigma(a_2)$.
This implies that $\tau(\sigma(a_1)) = \tau(\sigma(a_2))$
which contradicts the assumption that $x \in A$, $\tau(\sigma(x))$ is an injective function.
Hence $a_1$ and $a_2$ cannot exist and $\sigma$ must be an injective function.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Exercise 1.2.2}:
Decide which of the following are equivalence relations on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$. For those
that are, prove it. For those that are not, explain why. \newline
\newline
(i) $x \sim y$ if $\norm{x - y} \le 3$ \newline

(ii) $x \sim y$ if $\norm{x - y} \ge 3$ \newline

(iii) $x \sim y$ if $x$ and $y$ have the same digit in the 1's place (expressed in base 10). \newline
\begin{proof}
Let the set $D$ be the set of decimal digits, which would be exactly $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.
Note that $D \subset \mathbb{N}$.
Let $x_1, y_1, z_1 \in D$ be the digit in the one's place of $x, y, z \in \mathbb{N}$ respectively. \newline
\newline
First, because for any natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}, n$ is the same as itself,
therefore $x_1 \sim x_1$ and $y_1 \sim y_1$, so it is reflexive. \newline
\newline
Second, observe that if $x_1 \sim y_1$, then $x_1$ is the same number as $y_1$, but then $y_1$ is the same number as $x_1$,
and hence $y_1 \sim x_1$, so it is symmetric. \newline
\newline
Third, if $x_1 \sim y_1$ and $y_1 \sim z_1$, then $x_1$ is the same as $y_1$ and $y_1$ is the same as $z_1$,
so $x_1$ is the same as $z_1$, and hence $x_1 \sim z_1$, and therefore it is transitive. \newline
\newline
Finally, because we have shown that the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, by definition
this is an equivalence relation.
\end{proof}


(iv) $x \sim y$ if $x \ge y$ \newline
\begin{proof}
We will demonstrate a proof by counterexample. Let $x = 2$ and $y = 1$. In this scenario, $x \sim y$ because
$2 \ge 1$, however $y \sim x$ is false, because that would imply $1 \ge 2$, which is absurd. This relation
therefore does not demonstrate symmetry, and is therefore not an equivalence relation.
\end{proof}
